1. **Simple Future:** This is the most straightforward way to express future actions. You use the base form of the verb and typically add "will" or "shall" before it. For example:
    
    - I will go to the store tomorrow.
    - She shall call you later.
2. **Future Continuous (Progressive):** This tense is used to describe actions that will be in progress at a specific point in the future. It's formed by using "will be" or "shall be" followed by the base verb form with "-ing" added. For example:
    
    - I will be studying all evening.
    - They shall be working on the project tomorrow.
3. **Future Perfect:** This tense is used to describe actions that will be completed before a certain point in the future. It's formed using "will have" or "shall have" followed by the past participle of the verb. For example:
    
    - By next week, I will have finished my report.
    - She shall have completed the task by the time you arrive.
4. **Future Perfect Continuous (Progressive):** This tense describes actions that will have been ongoing for a duration of time leading up to a future point. It's formed by using "will have been" or "shall have been" followed by the base verb form with "-ing" added. For example:
    
    - By the time you get here, I will have been waiting for an hour.
    - They shall have been working on the project for a while when you join them.
